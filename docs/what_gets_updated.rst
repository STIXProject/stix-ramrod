What Gets Updated?
==================

The STIX and CybOX languages have grown over the years and seen several
revisions, each introducing more capabilities for structuring and
characterizing cyber threat intelligence data while also taking care of bug
fixes.

The following sections detail what *actually* happens to your STIX and CybOX
content during the **stix-ramrod** update process.

.. note::

    These sections don't detail *every* change made between STIX and CybOX
    language revisions. Some language changes are completely transparent to
    end-users and don't require any updates or translations at all.

    The sections below cover the transformations that **stix-ramrod** performs
    to render a schema-valid, updated XML document.
