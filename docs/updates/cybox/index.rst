Updates to CybOX Content
========================

The following sections detail the changes that **stix-ramrod** makes when
upgrading CybOX content.

.. note::

    The sections below do not detail the full breadth and depth of changes
    made to the CybOX language between releases. Some updates, such as the
    addition of new CybOX Objects or controlled vocabulary terms do not require
    any changes to be made to the source content during an update.

    The **stix-ramrod** documentation only describes updates to content which
    **must** or **should** be made in order to render a well-formed,
    schema-valid, properly-versioned CybOX document.

    To see a complete list of changes made to CybOX, see the `Release Notes`
    section of a `CybOXLanguage Release <http://cybox.mitre.org/language/>`_
    page.
